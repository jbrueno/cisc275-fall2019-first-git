First part of the lab:
In this space, type the sequence of commands you used to achieve the final state of all four files:

Untracked: all I did was create a new file and do nothing further with it, leaving it as 'untracked'
Modified: I added the file to the repo by using: git add filename, then git commit filename -m "commit message",
	  then I modified the file by adding random text, but did not commit the modified file.  Then I typed in git status
	  and the file shows up as modified
Staged: I used the command: git add filename, and then did nothing else, leaving the file staged but not committed
In the Repo: First I entered the command: git add filename, the the command: git commit filename -m "commit message"
	     and to check if the file was in the repo I used: git log to confirm
