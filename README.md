1. Create java files to make this code compile and run.

2. What five objects are created in the main?
	- a list of dogs
	- a dog named fido with 4 legs
	- a dog named fido with 3 legs
	- a dog named alfie with 4 legs
	- a comparator

3. Can you spot the Comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the Comparator?
	- I think that the comparator's constructor call is located in the second argument passed
	- to the Collections.sort method where it says: new Comparator<Animal>().  The class 
	- definition is located right after the constructor call and is located within the sort 
	- method's second parameter
